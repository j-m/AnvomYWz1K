## Why the random name?

This project was submitted as coursework to Coventry University, UK.
To reduce the chances of plagarism, we were asked to use a random 10 character string as the name of the repository.

## About

For this coursework, each student was assigned to one of 19 different tasks; this was **not** group work.  
I was tasked with creating "a community website to review games".  
We had creative freedom but had to use JavaScript, Koa, Puppeteer, and meet certain functional requirements.

To earn the higher marks we had to achieve/demonstrate:  

 - A complete system that met all requirements
 - Test-Driven Development
 - Continuous Development
 - Comprehensive unit, integration, and acceptance tests
 - 100% code coverage
 - Use of the GitFlow git branching model
 - Continuous Integration and Delivery
 - Plan the architecture of the system, complete with various types of UML models
 
I earned a score of 84/100; the feedback was positive with only nit-picks on the design and implementation.
